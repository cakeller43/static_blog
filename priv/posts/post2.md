## Let's get started!

We will start by making a new project with Mix. Mix the build tool for Elixir, it contains many useful commands 
for creating, building, and testing your project. Open a command prompt or terminal and run this command to make a new project.

```
mix new min_api --sup
```

`Note: --sup initializes a basic supervisor tree. I will go over what this does and why we need it later.`

You should see output similar to this.

Mix creates the project with a skeleton structure and a working test!

```
min_api  
|   .gitignore
|   mix.exs
|   README.md
|
+---config
|       config.exs
|
+---lib
|       min_api.ex
|
\---test
        min_api_test.exs
        test_helper.exs
```
I will give a brief description of the files that are generated by mix. 
You can find a more detailed description [here](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html). 
It is worth noting that files with a .exs extention are not compiled during a build of the project unlike .ex files. Most test and config files are scripts (.exs).  

`_build` - Build artifacts go here.  
`mix.exs` - This is where you specify dependcies and start 3rd party applications such as cowboy. 
            You can specify dependencies from [Hex](https://hex.pm/) (package manager for the Erlang ecosystem) and github.  
`.gitignore` - Default gitignore for Elixir projects.
`README.md` - Readme markdown file for github repos.
`config.exs` - This is a config file that can be used to configure your applications in the project. 
                Environment specific config files can also be imported through this one.  
`lib` - Your elixir files and modules.  
`min_api.ex` - This is where your application is started and where workers and supervisors are set up.  
`min_api_test.exs` - Basic test file with an example test written. Tests are written in ExUnit by default.  
`test_helper.exs` - File that initializes ExUnit to run tests.
